                <h2>Greetings!</h2>
                
                Thank you for deigning to grace my portfolio with your beautiful presence!
    
                
                My name, dear soul, is 
    
                <h1>Adesemi Adewumi Chloe Elumaro</h1>
                
                but my friends call me Dese or Semi (pronounced day-shay and Shay-mee respectively). I was born in the United States but have spent the better part of my childhood living in Nigeria (the country I consider to be my beautiful home), England, and India. I am currently a junior at Duke University doing my utmost best in studying Computer Science with a minor in Economics. Professionally, I aspire to be an entrepreneur and am really interested in exploring how the intersection of technology, education, and economics can help Nigeria and other developing countries and emerging markets play a larger role in the global economy. Personally however, I enrich my soul by learning about the French and Japansese language and culture, reading a ton of books of the historical romance, fantasy romance and self-help genres, and playing Japanese RPG gacha games such as Genshin impact, Tears of Themis, and Twisted wonderland. I also dabble in video editing so check out my Youtube channel if you have the time! If you would like to know more about my humble person, do not be afraid to reach out to me via the links below. I am always happy to chat! In the meantime, let's have fun exploring the rest of my portfolio!
