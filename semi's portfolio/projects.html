            <p>So you're interested in some of the technical projects I've created so far, are you? I must admit that it's not much and I still have a lot to learn but here are some of the humble yet enriching projects I've worked on so far! What you see here however is only the beginning! There will be more to come, I can promise you that! </p>

            <h1>Google Software Product Sprint (SPS)</h1>
    
            <h3>Technologies used: CSS, HTML, Javascript</h3>
    
            <p>
    
                During the summer of 2020, I was invited to collaborate with a team of peers to design and implement a web application using Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS over the course of 10 weeks, leveraging various Google Cloud Platform APIs, including App Engine and Datastore.
    
                I also had the opportunity to practiced industry best practices such as: contributing to open source software using Git and GitHub, conducting code reviews, participating in distributed development, designing new components and interfaces and leading them to completion. It was a very enlightening experience.
            </p>

            <h1>Fyurr app</h1>
    
            <h3>Technologies used: Python, Flask, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PostgresSQL </h2>
    
    
            <p>
    
                During the summer of 2020, amidst the pandemic, my internship with Facebook was cancelled but instead I was sponsored to learn a course with udacity and this app is the product of that.

                Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking website that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues.
                Essentially, I created a CRUD application using SQLAlchemy ORM, Postgre SQL as database, and Flask-Migrate for creating and running schema migrations. I also built out the data models and model interactions to be able to store, retrieve and update data from a PostgreSQL database.
            </p>

            <h1>Black shops matter</h1>
    
            <p>
                For a school hackathon, I collaborated with a team of peers to build a chrome extension for Amazon that finds alternative black-produced products where buyers can check the extension for links to those products. This project won third place in a the hackathon (HACKDtech).
    
                We built a Chrome extension to help shoppers be conscious of where they are buying from.
                When shopping on Amazon if buyers find a product that has an alternative from a black business a notification will pop up and buyers can check our extension for links to those products.
                Our extension has a list of business alternatives with links to their websites that fall in the same product category as the product the shopper is buying.
                You can read more about the project, challlenges we ran into while building it and future changes <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SsXq68EMiDunt8VGsOBnhI-uVWWspX28yRIxlouO5MI/edit#slide=id.g8dba9aa359_1_393" target="_blank">here</a> and I've posted a demo of it below!
