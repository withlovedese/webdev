            <h1>Books</h1>
    
            <p>
                I adore books. I remember the first time I actually “read” a book. By “read” I do not mean just looking at and comprehending the meaning of the words by mentally interpreting the characters of which it is composed. By "read" I mean jumping into the book. Being a part of the book. Understanding the words so much that you quite literally feel them. You feel the characters. You feel the setting. You feel the emotions felt by the characters deep in your bones. Yes, I remember the first time I “read” a book and it quite literally changed my life. I truly believe that they are a core part of who I am as an individual.  My personality is the sum total of all the qualities I perceived to be the most striking of my best characters in the books I've read till date. I'm open to any genres but I really like the historical fiction, romance and fantasy subgenres. Here are a few of my favorite titles!

            <h1>Youtube</h1>
    
            <p>
                For a long time I didn't fully comprehend what Youtube was. My only exposure to youtube before I was 18 was when I was looking for any sort of tutorial. I would just google "How to do ..." and I'd click on the youtube video. That was it. I had no idea it was much larger than that but when I fully understood what it was, I was enchanted and taught myself how to make and edit videos. It was a truly fulfilling experience. I used to make lifestyle vlogs but my interests have changed and now I'm creating a new channel that's still a work in progres but here's a vlog I made if you're interested!

            <h1>Anime and Manga</h1>
    
            <p>
                I'm a passionate advocate for this genre of entertainment. In a relatively short amount of time, it's become a part of who I am. I've watched over 300+ animes and read over 500+ manga in the span of about 2 years. It's just a very diverse, fascinating and engaging form of entertainment! If you'd like to find out more or chat with me about it, you can reach me and browse some of my reads <a href="https://anilist.co/user/withlovedese/" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h1>Games</h1>
    
            <p>
    
                In my spare time, I like to play Japanese gacha RPGs. The story line for these types of games tend to be very intriguing, funny, and engaging so I've come to love them. Currently, I play Genshin Impact, Twisted wonderland, Ensemble Stars!! Music, and Tears of Themis.
